# 👩🏽‍🏫 Today's Story

Today, the learners will work through a series of steps to
implement stateful class-based components. Here's a [ZIP
file](../../resources/react-app-with-forms.zip) that has a
final state in it, including the stretch goal.

We expect them to be challenged by this because it is the
first time they're using JavaScript classes. There's a lot
of narrative in the story trying to explain how stateful
classes work.
